GenAI
Focused on software development and enterprise architecture as strategy, I am now aiming to utilize my unique traits to deliver on data-driven decisions, therefore I find it highly relevant to become a part of your department, where I can apply my analytical mindset for the given tasks at hand or participate in the continuation of applying LLMs as a knowledge base.
I see great potential in directly adding value by developing data pipelines,
enhancing knowledge retention and management while considering legal and ethical aspects throughout the AI solution lifecycle through active collaboration. My character thrives in dynamic and challenging settings,
making me an ideal fit for the Full Stack Data Scientist role you offer.
Throughout my education, I have a solid grasp of SQL, Python, and data analysis. Further, I am decently paced in learning new IT tools.

Motivation
I am driven to progress in the field of AI,
particularly focusing on Large Language Models,
knowledge extraction/engineering, and Natural Language Processing. Currently I am trying to build an "jobapplication agent" to effectively 

My focal point of interest is based on establishing trust between relationships across internal and external stakeholders,
a competence I have acquired after several years in the hospitality industry,
ranging from small taverns to high-end cocktail venues and private service.

This experience has equipped me with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to understand and respond to diverse customer needs effectively.
In the context of chatbot development,
these skills may be ideal for creating chatbots that can provide context-aware interactions with regard to different customer perspectives,
ensuring a user-friendly experience for both customers and internal employees.

I am dedicated to thoroughly understanding a given situation,
whether technical or non-technical,
to back these efforts and am excited about the prospect of working alongside your team.

My passion for AI is motivated by genuine curiosity and the satisfaction that comes from tackling complex problems.
Whether working independently or as part of a team,
I am committed to addressing every necessary element to deliver a well-rounded AI solution.
I am enthusiastic about engaging in an environment that encourages detailed and strategic discussions on AI applications
and figuring out how to turn AI into an actual revenue stream.

Contributing to projects in MLOps, with consideration to DevOps and incorporating the latest AI innovations into actionable solutions,
is very interesting. I believe all of these aspects are important when working with AI or ML, including compliance with GDPR and AI ACT.

What I can offer
The demands of this role suit well with my prior experiences in test (IT) and project management (primarily in construction).
These have equipped me to translate business needs into technical requirements and provide a solid understanding of legal and political aspects.
For instance, managing construction projects required detailed planning, coordination, and adherence to regulatory standards.
Similarly, developing and implementing AI models necessitates careful project management to ensure that the bots are designed, tested, and deployed effectively, meeting both technical specifications and user requirements.
My ability to manage complex projects and navigate regulatory considerations directly translates to overseeing IT projects, ensuring they are compliant with business goals.

Lastly, my master thesis utilized foundational transformer models to semi-automatically generate PEST analyses,
supplemented with Named Entity Recognition and summarization techniques. This project involved analyzing publicly available data to provide macroeconomic insights,
particularly concerning market expansion. The objective was to synthesize summaries from vectorized unstructured data, retrieving information based on semantic similarity and ranking with foundation models.
This experience is directly applicable to developing models that can understand and process complex data to provide relevant knowledge,
real-time responses, and thus, provides internal employee efficiency in their daily tasks.

I am committed to sustainable solutions and consistently execute project objectives with broader business goals.
I am keen to bring my personal interest in AI trends into practical scenarios,
engaging with like-minded individuals who share a similar enthusiasm.

Continued Learning
I am committed to continuously learning and currently exploring areas such as knowledge engineering,
decision intelligence, and multi-agent learning frameworks. Additionally,
I am open to learning what is needed and try to stay current with the latest advancements in AI,
particularly within the domains of NLP and generative AI.

Thank You Note
Thank you for your time. I look forward to the chance to discuss how my background, ambitions, and alignment with the goals of the organization.
I am positive about potentially contributing to your projects and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.
