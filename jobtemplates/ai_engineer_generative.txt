Data Scientist

I reached out due to my interest in AI, Software
Development/Engineering, and Knowledge management.

Motivation
I am driven to progress in the field of AI, particularly focusing on Large Language Models, knowledge extraction, and Natural Language Processing.
My goal is to ensure that every AI implementation has a solid foundation of reliable data.
I am dedicated to setting up thorough data agreements to back these efforts and am excited about the prospect of working alongside your team.
My passion for AI is motivated by genuine curiosity and the satisfaction derived from tackling complex problems.
Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am committed to addressing every necessary element to deliver a well-rounded AI solution, including aspects of security and compliance with GDPR and AI-ACT.
I am enthusiastic about engaging in an environment that encourages detailed and strategic discussions on AI applications.
It aligns perfectly with my career objectives. Contributing to projects that cover DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps, and incorporating the latest AI innovations into actionable solutions, is very interesting.
The demands of this role, particularly the need for effective communication among various stakeholders combined with a keen interest in continuous learning, position me as a promising long-term candidate with fresh ideas.
Addressing all facets essential to a robust AI solution, including security measures and adherence to GDPR & AI-ACT standards, is integral. I am keen to bring my personal interest in AI trends into practical scenarios, engaging with peers who share a similar enthusiasm.
I see great potential in directly adding value by developing data pipelines, enhancing knowledge retention, fostering rapid innovation, and considering legal and ethical aspects throughout the AI solution lifecycle through active collaboration. My character thrives in dynamic and challenging settings, making me an ideal fit for the Full-stack Data Scientist role you offer.

Skills
My experience spans various settings, from everyday to luxury environments in the hospitality industry, where I developed strong communication skills.
My prior experiences equipped me to translate business needs into technical requirements effectively.
I am committed to sustainable solutions and consistently strive to align project objectives with broader business goals.

Education
In the summer of 2023, I completed my Master's degree in Data Science ICT.
My thesis utilized foundational transformer models to semi-automatically generate PEST analyses, which were enhanced with Named Entity Recognition and summarization techniques.
This project involved analyzing publicly available data to provide macroeconomic insights, particularly concerning market expansion.
The objective was to synthesize summaries from vectorized unstructured data, retrieving information based on semantic similarity and ranking through general-purpose language models.

Additionally, I hold a Professional Bachelor's Degree in Economics & IT.
For my bachelor's thesis, I developed an enterprise architecture strategy for EnviroProcess Denmark and its parent company, EnviroProcess AB.
This strategy was designed to align IT initiatives with the subsidiaryâ€™s core competencies, specific service knowledge, unique industry insights, and overall project execution.

Continued Learning
I am committed to continuously enhancing my skills and am currently exploring areas such as knowledge engineering, decision intelligence, and multi-agent learning frameworks.
Additionally, I open to learn what is needed and I try to stay current with the latest advancements in AI, particularly within the domains of NLP and generative AI.

Thank you for your time
I look forward to the chance to discuss how my background, ambitions, and the alignment with the goals of the organisation. I am enthusiastic about potentially contributing to your projects and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.
